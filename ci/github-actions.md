# GitHub Actions

## About

Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions.
You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a completely customized workflow.

GitHub Actions is free for open source repos!

It is also free if you use [self-hosted](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) build machines.
