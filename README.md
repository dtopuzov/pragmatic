## Setup

Scripts for initial setup of machines can be found in `setup` folder.

Please read [setup/README.md](setup/README.md) for more details.

## Sikuli

[Sikuli](http://sikulix.com/) is not a tool for mobile testing, it just drive everything you can see on your desktop.

Since Android Emulators and iOS Simulators are actually desktop apps Sikuli might be useful if you have complex workflows where you need to control some desktop app and emulator/simulator in the same time.

We will not spend much time on it in this course, but it worths showing the concept for image based testing.

Image based testing is powerful concept (think about self driving cars, they do not find ids, they look to the current situation as images and take actions based on image analysis) and can be implemented with other tools as well.

## Appium

Appium examples can be found in `appium` folder.

Before start with them first read about [Official Docs](http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/intro/).

For more advanced topics [this](https://appiumpro.com/) blog is very useful.
